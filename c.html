    <h1>Challenges and Limitations of Rainwater Harvesting</h1><br>
    <p>While rainwater harvesting offers significant benefits, it also presents challenges and limitations:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 30px; color: white;">
        <li>Initial Investment Cost</li>
        <li>Maintenance Requirements</li>
        <li>Water Quality Concerns</li>
        <li>Space Constraints</li>
        <li>Seasonal Variability in Rainfall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The initial investment cost can be a barrier for some, particularly in developing countries. Rainwater harvesting 
        systems require regular maintenance to ensure proper functionality and prevent contamination. Water quality 
        concerns arise due to potential contamination from pollutants like bird droppings, leaves, and dust. Space 
        limitations, especially in urban areas, can make it challenging to install large rainwater harvesting systems. The 
        seasonal variability in rainfall can affect the reliability of rainwater harvesting, particularly during dry seasons</p>
