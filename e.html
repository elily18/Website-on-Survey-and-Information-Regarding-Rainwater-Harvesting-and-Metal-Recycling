    <h1>Recycling of Metals from Electronic Gadgets</h1><br>
    <p>Recycling of metals from electronic gadgets, also known as e-waste, is an essential step towards controlling metal 
        pollution and ensuring a sustainable future. E-waste contains valuable metals like gold, copper, silver, and 
        platinum, which can be recovered and reused. The recycling process typically involves:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 30px;">
        <li>Collection and Sorting of E-Waste</li>
            <li>Disassembly and Pre-Treatment</li>
                <li>Metal Extraction and Refining</li>
                    <li>Production of New Products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>E-waste recycling requires advanced technologies and skilled personnel to extract metals efficiently and safely. The 
        extracted metals can be used to manufacture new products, reducing the demand for virgin materials and
        minimizing environmental impact.</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 30px;">
        <li>Recycling of metals from e-waste offers several benefits, including:</li>
        <li>Reduced Metal Pollution</li>
        <li>Conservation of Natural Resources</li>
        <li>Economic Benefits</li>
        <li>Job Creation</li>
        <li>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By recycling metals from e-waste, we can significantly reduce metal pollution and conserve precious natural 
        resources. Recycling also creates economic opportunities and supports job creation in the recycling sector. The 
        process also reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to manufacturing new products from virgin materials</p>
